        <p><b>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler</b> (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter.
            <br> She started her career as a singer in the<a href="#"> acid jazz band Crisp</a> in the mid-1990s in <a href="#">Adelaide</a>.
            <br> In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album, titled <a href="#">OnlySee</a>, in
            <a href="#">Australia</a>. She moved to <a href="#">London</a> and provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7.
            <br> Sia released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, <a href="#">Colour the Small One</a>, in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sia moved to <a href="#">New York City</a> in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, <a href="#">Some People Have Real Problems</a> and We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
            <br> Each was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists,
            producing successful collaborations <a href="#">"Titanium"</a> (with<span class="dropdown"><a href="#">David

                    actress, and businesswoman</span></span>) and "Wild Ones" (with <a href="#">Flo Rida</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, <a href="#">1000 Forms of
                Fear</a>, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single <a href="#">"Chandelier"</a> and a trilogy of music videos co-directed by Sia and starring child dancer <span class="dropdown"><span><a href="#">Maddie
                        Ziegler</a><span class="dropdown-content"><img src="C:\Users\hp\Downloads\madd.jfif"><br>Madison
                        Nicole Ziegler is an American actress and dancer. </span></span>.<br></span>
            Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.[2] Her seventh studio album, This Is Acting (2016), spawned her first Billboard Hot 100 number one single, <a href="#">"Cheap
                Thrills"</a>.<br> The same year, she began her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, <a href="#">Everyday Is Christmas</a>, was released
            in 2017 and reissued in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018, she collaborated with Labrinth and Diplo in the group <a href="#">LSD</a>, and they released their self-titled debut album in April 2019. Sia has written many songs for films,
            and she directed a feature film, titled Music, which was released in early 2021 alongside an album, Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture.

            <p>
                In October 2013, Sia released "<a href="#">Elastic Heart</a>" featuring <a href="#">The Weeknd</a> and Diplo for the soundtrack of the American film <a href="#">The Hunger Games</a>: Catching Fire (2013). Sia executive-produced Brooke
                Candy's debut EP,
                <a href="#"></a>Opulence, released in May 2014, and co-wrote 3 songs on the EP. In July 2014, Sia released her own sixth studio album, <a href="#">1000 Forms of Fear</a>. She again collaborated with Greg Kurstin. The album debuted at No. 1 in the
                US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By October 2015, it was certified gold by the RIAA denoting 500,000 equivalent-album units sold in the United States. The record peaked at No. 1 in Australia and reached the top
                ten of charts in numerous European regions. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. By early 2016, the album had sold 1 million copies worldwide.

            <p>
                1000 Forms of Fear's lead single, "<a href="#">Chandelier</a>" was released in March 2014.<br> The song peaked at No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sia's first entry on that chart as a lead artist.
                <br> Elsewhere, the song experienced similar commercial success, ranking in the top ten of the record charts in Australia and numerous European regions.<br> As of January 2015, the single had sold 2 million copies in the United States.<br>                "
                <a href="#">Eye of the Needle</a>" and "
                <a href="#">Big Girls Cry</a>" were released as the second and third singles from the album, respectively, in June 2014. In January 2015, Sia released a solo version of "Elastic Heart" as the fourth single from 1000 Forms of Fear; it eventually
                reached the top 20 on the Hot 100.<br> At the 57th <a href="#">Annual Grammy Awards</a> (2015), Sia received four nominations for "Chandelier": Record of the Year, Song of the Year, <a href="#">Best Pop
                    Solo Performance and Best Music Video.<br></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                For performances of songs from 1000 Forms of Fear, Sia chose not to show her face, either facing away from audiences or hiding it behind oversized platinum blonde wigs. In videos for the singles "Chandelier", "<a href="#">Elastic Heart</a>"
                and "Big Girls Cry", choreographed by <a href="#">Ryan Heffington</a> and co-directed by Sia and <a href="#">Daniel Askill</a>, and in many of the promotional live performances, child dancer <a href="#">Maddie Ziegler</a> performed as
                a proxy for Sia in bobbed blonde wigs similar to Sia's familiar hairstyle.<br> The three videos have received a total of more than 3 billion views on Vevo. Sia explained to Kristen Wiig in an interview in Interview magazine that she decided<br>                to conceal her face to avoid a celebrity lifestyle and maintain some privacy: "I'm trying to have some control over my image.<br> And I'm allowed to maintain some modicum of privacy. But also I would like not to be picked apart or for
                people to observe when I put on ten pounds or take off ten pounds or I have a hair extension out of place or my fake tan is botched.<br> Most people don't have to be under that pressure, and I'd like to be one of them."

                In November, Sia collaborated with composer J. Ralph on the soundtrack of the environmental documentary Racing Extinction, co-writing and singing the song "One Candle".<br> She also released two more songs from the album, "<a href="#">Bird Set Free</a>"
                and "<a href="#">One Million Bullets</a>".<br> "<a href="#">Cheap Thrills</a>" and "<a href="#">Reaper</a>" were subsequently released as promotional singles for the album.<br> Eventually, the single "Cheap Thrills", featuring Sean Paul,
                reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br> Sia released two videos for the song, one of which features Ziegler and two male dancers, while the other, featuring <a href="#">Sean Paul</a>, shows a 1950s style teen dance party; it has
                accumulated more than 1.4 billion views.

                Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in <a href="#">North America</a> from September to November 2016, featuring Ziegler.<br> As at Coachella and subsequent live performances, Sia appeared at the back of the stage with her familiar
                wig covering her face, while her dancers performed Heffington's choreography synchronised with pre-recorded videos played on big screens.<br> The tour received a warm reaction: "She let her dancers own center stage, carrying out one skit/performance
                after another as Sia delivered the soundtrack. ... It defied all the regular rules of pop concerts, which are usually designed to focus every ounce of the audience's attention on the star of the show. Yet, Sia's bold gamble paid off, resulting
                in one of the most daringly original and wholly satisfying shows of 2016."<br> Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic described the show as "part performance art, part interpretive dance. ... [Sia] sounded amazing. ... There's so much raw emotion
                in her songs.<br> And you can definitely hear that in her voice, but it becomes more visceral when you can also read it in the faces of her dancers, especially Ziegler. ... The entire performance was brilliantly staged, with one song flowing
                seamlessly into another".<br> Sia released the deluxe edition of This Is Acting in October 2016, which includes three new tracks, a remix version of "<a href="#">Move Your Body</a>" and a solo version of "<a href="#">The Greatest</a>".<br>                She was nominated for three 2017 Grammy Awards. Sia co-wrote and performed on a platinum-selling single, "<a href="#">Dusk Till Dawn</a>", by Zayn.

                In 2018, Sia collaborated with English musician Labrinth and American DJ/record producer Diplo, under the name <a href="#">LSD</a>, to release four songs, which were then released as an EP called <a href="#">Mountains</a> on Spotify.<br>                The group released an album, Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present... LSD, in April 2019, containing the same four songs, five new songs and a previously released remix of their track "<a href="#">Genius</a>" with <a href="#">Lil Wayne</a>.<br>                Also in 2018, Sia was one of the narrators of Australian animal rights documentary Dominion, and shared in a 2018 Award of Excellence from the <a href="#">Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sia's ninth album, <a href="#">Music</a> – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture, was released in February 2021 in connection with the release of her film, Music.<br> She is reportedly working on her tenth album, to be titled Reasonable
                Woman.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2009, after leaving Zero 7, Sia dedicated herself entirely to her solo career. <a href="#">We Are
                    Born</a> (2010), incorporated various pop styles, including synthpop and R&B, with introspective themes accompanied by more insistent and livelier rhythms.<br> 1000 Forms of Fear (2014) consolidated her connection with pop (with traces
                of electropop, reggae and hip-hop), while This Is Acting (2016) is mostly composed of songs written by Sia with other female pop artists in mind, but the artists did not include the songs on their albums. Sia described songwriting for
                others as "play-acting.<br> "The Guardian's Kitty Empire commented that the latter album
                <blockquote>"provides an obvious counterpoint to Sia's more personal album of 2014, 1000 Forms of Fear, whose stonking single, "Chandelier", tackled her intoxicated past. This Is Acting makes plain the fact of manufacture – a process akin to bespoke
                    tailoring."
                </blockquote>
                The record also alternates reggae and <a href="#">electropop</a> with more introspective themes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In her 2016 live performances, Sia's music was part of performance-art-like shows that involved dance and theatrical effects.<br> An <a href="#">MTV</a> News writer opined that
                <blockquote>"Sia's throaty, slurred vocals are her norm"</blockquote>, while a contributor to The Fader noted that
                <blockquote>"in the Billboard Hot 100 landscape, Sia's songwriting voice, which deals with depression and addiction, is singular—her actual voice even more so."<br></blockquote> <a href="#">Everyday Is
                    Christmas</a> (2017), Sia's first release of Christmas music, is a pop album that gives old-fashioned holiday music "some 21st century pop gloss" and is made for those who grow tired of the classics.<br> Music – Songs from and Inspired
                by the Motion Picture (2021) further developed Sia's pop music catalogue, with the album incorporating more electropop and reggae, alongside R&B and EDM. National Public Radio called Sia "the 21st century's most resilient songwriter".

                Sia married documentary filmmaker <a href="#">Erik Anders Lang</a> at her home in Palm Springs, <a href="#">California</a>, in August 2014.<br> The couple revealed their separation in December 2016.
                <br> During a 2014 appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Sia was asked if she was religious, to which she responded, "I believe in a Higher Power and it's called 'Whatever Dude' and he's a queer, surfing Santa that's a bit like my grandpa,
                so yes."
                <br> In the same interview, she stated that she is a feminist and that Whatever Dude divinely inspired the lyrics she wrote for <a href="#">Rihanna</a>'s song "Diamonds".<br> One of Sia's tattoos on her hand reads "Whatever Dude". Sia
                is a cousin of Australian Christian rock musician Peter Furler.
