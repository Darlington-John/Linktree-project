    <p><b>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler</b> (/ˈsiːə/ SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. She started her career as a singer in the<a href="#"> acid jazz band Crisp</a> in the mid-1990s in <a href="#">Adelaide</a>. In 1997, when
        Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album, titled <a href="#">OnlySee</a>, in <a href="#">Australia</a>. She moved to <a href="#">London</a> and provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio album, Healing
        Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, <a href="#">Colour the Small One</a>, in 2004.</p>
    <p>
        Sia moved to <a href="#">New York City</a> in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, <a href="#">Some People Have Real Problems</a> and We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified
        gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful
        collaborations <a href="#">"Titanium"</a> (with <a href="#">David Guetta</a>), "Diamonds" (with <a href="#">Rihanna</a>) and "Wild Ones" (with <a href="#">Flo Rida</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, <a href="#">1000 Forms of Fear</a>, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single <a href="#">"Chandelier"</a> and a trilogy of music
        videos co-directed by Sia and starring child dancer <a href="#">Maddie Ziegler</a>. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.[2] Her seventh studio album, This Is Acting (2016), spawned her first Billboard
        Hot 100 number one single, <a href="#">"Cheap Thrills"</a>. The same year, she began her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, <a href="#">Everyday Is Christmas</a>,
        was released in 2017 and reissued in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018, she collaborated with Labrinth and Diplo in the group <a href="#">LSD</a>, and they released their self-titled debut album in April 2019. Sia has written many songs for
        films, and she directed a feature film, titled Music, which was released in early 2021 alongside an album, Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        She is an advocate for animal rights. Among the <a href="#">accolades</a> received by Sia are nearly a dozen ARIA Awards, 9 <a href="#">Grammy Award</a> nominations and an <a href="#">MTV Video Music Award</a>.

    <h2>
        Early Life and Career
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in Adelaide, South Australia. Her father, Phil Colson, is a musician, and her mother, Loene Furler, is an art lecturer. Sia is the niece of actor-singer <a href="#">Kevin Colson</a>. Sia said
        that as a child she imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, <a href="#">Stevie Wonder</a> and Sting, whom she cites as early influences. She attended Adelaide High School. In the mid-1990s, Sia started a career as a singer in the local
        acid jazz band Crisp. Sia collaborated with the band and contributed vocals to their album Word and the Deal (1996) and EP Delirium (1997). In 1997 Crisp disbanded, and Sia released her debut studio album, OnlySee, on Flavoured Records, in Australia,
        on 23 December. The album sold about 1,200 copies. Unlike her later albums, OnlySee was marketed under her full name, "Sia Furler". It was produced by <a href="#">Jesse Flavell.</a>

    <p>
        After Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, where she performed as a background vocalist for British band <a href="#">Jamiroquai</a>. She also provided vocals for English downtempo group <a href="#">Zero 7</a> on their first three studio
        albums and toured with the group. On Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks including the single "Destiny", which peaked at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on "Somersault"
        and "Speed Dial No. 2" (from the album When It Falls). In 2006, Sia collaborated with Zero 7 for their third album, <a href="#">The Garden</a>.
    </p>
    <P>
        In 2004, Sia released her third studio album, <a href="#">Colour the Small One</a>. The album employs a mixture of acoustic instruments and electronic backing to her material. The album spawned four singles, including "<a href="#">Don't Bring Me Down</a>"
        and "<a href="#">Breathe Me</a>", the latter of which charted in the United Kingdom, Denmark and France.

    <p>
        In 2007, Sia released a live album, <a href="#">Lady Croissant</a>, which included eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording—"Pictures". A year later, she left Zero 7 on friendly
        terms, replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band's frontwoman. Sia released her fourth studio album, <a href="#">Some People Have Real Problems</a> on 8 January 2008. The album peaked at No. 41 in Australia and was certified gold by the Australian
        Recording Industry Association. It charted at No. 26 on the US Billboard 200, becoming Sia's first to chart in the United States. Some People Have Real Problems yielded four singles, including "<a href="#">The Girl You Lost to Cocaine</a>". It
        peaked at No. 11 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Spain; it additionally reached No. 8 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs. Another single from the album was "<a href="#">Soon We'll Be Found</a>".
    </p>
    <p>
        In June 2010, Sia released her fifth studio album, <a href="#">We Are Born</a>. The release peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The release of the album was preceded
        by three singles: the lead single, <a href="#">"You've Changed</a>", was released in December 2009 and charted at No. 31 in Australia. The follow-up single, "<a href="#">Clap Your Hands</a>", peaked at No. 17 in Australia, No. 10 in the Netherlands
        and No. 27 in Switzerland. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010, We Are Born earned Sia two categories won: Best Independent Release and Best Pop Release. Meanwhile, at the 2011 APRA Music Awards, Sia received a nomination for Song of the Year for
        "Clap Your Hands". To promote We Are Born, Sia gave the We <a href="#">Meaning You Tour</a>, which visited North America and Europe in April–May 2010. She followed this with the We Are Born Tour, which visited Australia in February 2011 and
        <a href="#">North America</a> in July–August 2011.

        <figcaption>Sia 1000 Forms of Fear Album</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        In October 2013, Sia released "<a href="#">Elastic Heart</a>" featuring <a href="#">The Weeknd</a> and Diplo for the soundtrack of the American film <a href="#">The Hunger Games</a>: Catching Fire (2013). Sia executive-produced Brooke Candy's
        debut EP,
        <a href="#"></a>Opulence, released in May 2014, and co-wrote 3 songs on the EP. In July 2014, Sia released her own sixth studio album, <a href="#">1000 Forms of Fear</a>. She again collaborated with Greg Kurstin. The album debuted at No. 1 in the US Billboard
        200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By October 2015, it was certified gold by the RIAA denoting 500,000 equivalent-album units sold in the United States. The record peaked at No. 1 in Australia and reached the top ten of charts in numerous
        European regions. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. By early 2016, the album had sold 1 million copies worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
        1000 Forms of Fear's lead single, "<a href="#">Chandelier</a>" was released in March 2014. The song peaked at No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sia's first entry on that chart as a lead artist. Elsewhere, the song experienced similar
        commercial success, ranking in the top ten of the record charts in Australia and numerous European regions. As of January 2015, the single had sold 2 million copies in the United States. "<a href="#">Eye of the Needle</a>" and "<a href="#">Big Girls Cry</a>"
        were released as the second and third singles from the album, respectively, in June 2014. In January 2015, Sia released a solo version of "Elastic Heart" as the fourth single from 1000 Forms of Fear; it eventually reached the top 20 on the Hot
        100. At the 57th <a href="#">Annual Grammy Awards</a> (2015), Sia received four nominations for "Chandelier": Record of the Year, Song of the Year, <a href="#">Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Music Video.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For performances of songs from 1000 Forms of Fear, Sia chose not to show her face, either facing away from audiences or hiding it behind oversized platinum blonde wigs. In videos for the singles "Chandelier", "<a href="#">Elastic Heart</a>" and
        "Big Girls Cry", choreographed by <a href="#">Ryan Heffington</a> and co-directed by Sia and <a href="#">Daniel Askill</a>, and in many of the promotional live performances, child dancer <a href="#">Maddie Ziegler</a> performed as a proxy for
        Sia in bobbed blonde wigs similar to Sia's familiar hairstyle. The three videos have received a total of more than 3 billion views on Vevo. Sia explained to Kristen Wiig in an interview in Interview magazine that she decided to conceal her face
        to avoid a celebrity lifestyle and maintain some privacy: "I'm trying to have some control over my image. And I'm allowed to maintain some modicum of privacy. But also I would like not to be picked apart or for people to observe when I put on
        ten pounds or take off ten pounds or I have a hair extension out of place or my fake tan is botched. Most people don't have to be under that pressure, and I'd like to be one of them." The video for Elastic Heart "courted controversy and plaudits
        in equal measure", with some commentators perceiving it to have paedophilic undertones due to the relative ages of the dancers. Sia explained that the two dancers represented "warring 'Sia' self states", but she nevertheless apologised on Twitter
        to anyone who was "triggered". <a href="#">Gia Kourlas</a> wrote in The New York Times in 2016 that Sia's collaborations with Heffington have "done more to raise the standards of dance in pop music than nearly any current artist integrating the
        forms". The "Chandelier" video was ranked as the 10th "greatest music video" of the 2010s by <a href="#">Billboard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2014, Sia contributed to the soundtrack to the 2014 film adaptation of the Broadway musical Annie. Sia, along with producer Greg Kurstin, wrote three new songs for the film as well as re-working songs from the musical. Sia, Kurstin and the film's director
        Will Gluck were nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd <a href="#">Golden Globe Awards</a> for "<a href="#">Opportunity</a>".

        2015–2017: This Is Acting

    <p>
        <div class="main">
            In November, Sia collaborated with composer J. Ralph on the soundtrack of the environmental documentary Racing Extinction, co-writing and singing the song "One Candle". She also released two more songs from the album, "<a href="#">Bird Set Free</a>"
            and "<a href="#">One Million Bullets</a>". "<a href="#">Cheap Thrills</a>" and "<a href="#">Reaper</a>" were subsequently released as promotional singles for the album. Eventually, the single "Cheap Thrills", featuring Sean Paul, reached No.
            1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Sia released two videos for the song, one of which features Ziegler and two male dancers, while the other, featuring <a href="#">Sean Paul</a>, shows a 1950s style teen dance party; it has accumulated more than
            1.4 billion views.</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in <a href="#">North America</a> from September to November 2016, featuring Ziegler. As at Coachella and subsequent live performances, Sia appeared at the back of the stage with her familiar wig covering
        her face, while her dancers performed Heffington's choreography synchronised with pre-recorded videos played on big screens. The tour received a warm reaction: "She let her dancers own center stage, carrying out one skit/performance after another
        as Sia delivered the soundtrack. ... It defied all the regular rules of pop concerts, which are usually designed to focus every ounce of the audience's attention on the star of the show. Yet, Sia's bold gamble paid off, resulting in one of the
        most daringly original and wholly satisfying shows of 2016." Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic described the show as "part performance art, part interpretive dance. ... [Sia] sounded amazing. ... There's so much raw emotion in her songs. And you
        can definitely hear that in her voice, but it becomes more visceral when you can also read it in the faces of her dancers, especially Ziegler. ... The entire performance was brilliantly staged, with one song flowing seamlessly into another". Sia
        released the deluxe edition of This Is Acting in October 2016, which includes three new tracks, a remix version of "<a href="#">Move Your Body</a>" and a solo version of "<a href="#">The Greatest</a>". She was nominated for three 2017 Grammy Awards.
        Sia co-wrote and performed on a platinum-selling single, "<a href="#">Dusk Till Dawn</a>", by Zayn.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2017–present: Everyday Is Christmas, LSD and Music
    </h3>
    <p>
        In 2018, Sia collaborated with English musician Labrinth and American DJ/record producer Diplo, under the name <a href="#">LSD</a>, to release four songs, which were then released as an EP called <a href="#">Mountains</a> on Spotify. The group
        released an album, Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present... LSD, in April 2019, containing the same four songs, five new songs and a previously released remix of their track "<a href="#">Genius</a>" with <a href="#">Lil Wayne</a>. Also in 2018, Sia was
        one of the narrators of Australian animal rights documentary Dominion, and shared in a 2018 Award of Excellence from the <a href="#">Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sia's ninth album, <a href="#">Music</a> – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture, was released in February 2021 in connection with the release of her film, Music. She is reportedly working on her tenth album, to be titled Reasonable Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2009, after leaving Zero 7, Sia dedicated herself entirely to her solo career. <a href="#">We Are Born</a> (2010), incorporated various pop styles, including synthpop and R&B, with introspective themes accompanied by more insistent and livelier
        rhythms. 1000 Forms of Fear (2014) consolidated her connection with pop (with traces of electropop, reggae and hip-hop), while This Is Acting (2016) is mostly composed of songs written by Sia with other female pop artists in mind, but the artists
        did not include the songs on their albums. Sia described songwriting for others as "play-acting. "The Guardian's Kitty Empire commented that the latter album
        <blockquote>"provides an obvious counterpoint to Sia's more personal album of 2014, 1000 Forms of Fear, whose stonking single, "Chandelier", tackled her intoxicated past. This Is Acting makes plain the fact of manufacture – a process akin to bespoke tailoring."</blockquote>
        The record also alternates reggae and <a href="#">electropop</a> with more introspective themes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In her 2016 live performances, Sia's music was part of performance-art-like shows that involved dance and theatrical effects. An <a href="#">MTV</a> News writer opined that
        <blockquote>"Sia's throaty, slurred vocals are her norm"</blockquote>, while a contributor to The Fader noted that
        <blockquote>"in the Billboard Hot 100 landscape, Sia's songwriting voice, which deals with depression and addiction, is singular—her actual voice even more so."</blockquote> <a href="#">Everyday Is Christmas</a> (2017), Sia's first release of Christmas music,
        is a pop album that gives old-fashioned holiday music "some 21st century pop gloss" and is made for those who grow tired of the classics. Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture (2021) further developed Sia's pop music catalogue,
        with the album incorporating more electropop and reggae, alongside R&B and EDM. National Public Radio called Sia "the 21st century's most resilient songwriter".
    </p>
    <h3>
        Personal life
    </h3>
    <h4>Relationships and family</h4>
    <p>
        Sia married documentary filmmaker <a href="#">Erik Anders Lang</a> at her home in Palm Springs, <a href="#">California</a>, in August 2014. The couple revealed their separation in December 2016. During a 2014 appearance on The Howard Stern Show,
        Sia was asked if she was religious, to which she responded, "I believe in a Higher Power and it's called 'Whatever Dude' and he's a queer, surfing Santa that's a bit like my grandpa, so yes." In the same interview, she stated that she is a feminist
        and that Whatever Dude divinely inspired the lyrics she wrote for <a href="#">Rihanna</a>'s song "Diamonds". One of Sia's tattoos on her hand reads "Whatever Dude". Sia is a cousin of Australian Christian rock musician Peter Furler.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2019, Sia adopted two boys who were aging out of the foster care system. In 2020, Sia announced that she had become a grandmother when one of her two 19-year-old sons had fathered twins.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Mental health and substance use
    </h4>

        </iframe>
        <p>
            Sia has suffered from depression, addictions to painkillers and alcohol. In 2010, she wrote a suicide note, planning to overdose. A friend phoned her and, unintentionally, saved her life. Following this, Sia joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Sia cancelled
            various promotional events and shows due to her poor health in 2010. She cited extreme lethargy and panic attacks and considered retiring permanently from performing and touring. She stated that she had been diagnosed with <a href="#">Graves' disease</a>.
            Later that year, Sia said her health was improving after rest and thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In 2019, Sia stated that she suffers from <a href="#">Ehlers–Danlos syndrome</a>, and in 2020, she stated that she has been diagnosed with
            complex post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from childhood traumas.
